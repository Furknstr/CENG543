We introduce a simple geometrical construction similar to covariant holographic entanglement
entropy but with the addition of a new term proportional to boundary region volume. This new
procedure has properties strongly resembling classical Shannon entropy of probability distributions
rather than von Neumann entropy, so we call the quantity holographic Shannon entropy.
The
holographic Shannon entropy of a region A is divergent in AdS/CFT, but upon regulation, it appears
to be equal to the outer entropy of the entanglement wedge of A with the entanglement wedge of the
complement of A held ﬁxed. The construction is unambiguous when applied to compact surfaces
with convex shape in general spacetimes obeying the null curvature condition (of which AdS with
a regulator is a special case). In this context we prove that holographic Shannon entropy obeys
monotonicity, a key property of Shannon entropy, as well as all known balanced inequalities of
dynamical holographic entanglement entropy. In the static case, we explain why there must exist
some classical probability distribution on random variables locally distributed on the boundary with
the property that the Shannon entropies of all marginals are exactly reproduced by the holographic
Shannon entropy formula.

OVERVIEW

Perhaps the most signiﬁcant recent development to
arise from research on holographic entanglement entropy
[1, 2] was establishing the modern form of subregion du-
ality [3]. The possibility that a region A on the boundary
of an asymptotically AdS spacetime is dual to a speciﬁc
bulk subregion was originally investigated from a causal
structure perspective [4], but it has since been discov-
ered that the entanglement wedge of A [5], the bulk re-
gion between A and its entangling surface, is the most
reasonable thing to call the bulk region associated with
A. Subregion duality is a major breakthrough. It reveals
the role of quantum error correction in quantum gravity
[6] and allows for some notion of spatial subsystems in
quantum gravity, a subject where locality is notoriously
absent [7, 8].
Subregion duality leads to an intriguing although
poorly formed question: how many quantum states ﬁt
inside the entanglement wedge of a boundary region A?
Without worrying about the precise meaning of this ques-
tion, we can give two distinct answers. A is a subregion
on which a CFT is deﬁned, and upon ﬁxing a UV reg-
ulator, the region has a number of degrees of freedom
proportional to its volume |A| so e|A|/4GN is a potential
guess. On the other hand, a somewhat diﬀerent answer
is suggested by the Bousso bound (also known as the
covariant entropy bound) [9]. If A is regulated in a way
that makes its ingoing future null expansion non-positive,
then the extremality of the HRT surface of A allows us to
apply the Bousso bound to the spacelike surface A∪γ(A)
where γ(A) is the HRT surface of A. The upper bound
on light sheet entropy is the sum of the CFT volume of
A plus the area of γ(A). The former has a divergence

FIG. 1.
Holographic Shannon deﬁnition is deﬁned almost
identically to the HRT formula for covariant holographic en-
tanglement entropy. In the ﬁgure on the left above, the area
of the black surface gives the usual von Neumann entropy of
the red region A1. In the ﬁgure on the right, the area of the
black surface, which now includes A1 as well as its entangling
surface, produces what we call holographic Shannon entropy.

that dominates over the latter, but perhaps we are los-
ing a great deal of fascinating structure by ignoring the
interplay between the two terms.
In this paper, we choose to not ignore the second or the
ﬁrst term that arises from the Bousso bound when ap-
plied to an entanglement wedge. In doing so, we present
a geometrical construction with signiﬁcance that overlaps
between quantum gravity and information theory. Our
construction is very simple: we compute the quantity

H(A) =
1
4GN
(|A| + |γ(A)|)
(1)

where |A| is the regulated area of a boundary region A
and |γ(A)| is the regulated area of the the HRT surface
of A. Figure 1 illustrates the procedure. Equation (1) is
much cleaner when applied to convex compact surfaces in
general spacetimes obeying the null curvature condition

along the lines of proposals for extending holographic en-
tanglement to general spacetimes [10, 11] in which case
the ﬁrst term is not much larger than the second.
The function H in equation (1) will be referred to as
holographic Shannon entropy regardless of whether it is
applied in AdS/CFT with a cutoﬀor on a convex sur-
face in a non-AdS spacetime. The motivation for calling
it a Shannon entropy comes from a collection of results.
In the case where the static RT formula applies for von
Neumann entropy, a result due to Gross and Walter [12]
allows us to prove that there must exist a probability dis-
tribution p on a collection of (correlated ) random vari-
ables locally distributed along the boundary such that
for any subregion A, the marginal probability distribu-
tion pA has Shannon entropy given precisely by (1).
In the dynamical case, we are not currently able to
prove the existence of such a probability distribution,
but we can come close. We prove that H satisﬁes mono-
tonicity: H(AB) ≥H(A), a critical feature of Shan-
non entropy, and we also conﬁrm that it satisﬁes every
known balanced inequality for the dynamical holographic
entropy cone. This immediately implies [13] that H satis-
ﬁes a number of known inequalities required for Shannon
entropy including the Zhang-Yeung inequality [14].
If
the dynamical holographic entropy cone turns out to be
equal to the static entropy cone, a very important open
problem[13], then we can can conclude that a probabil-
ity distribution realizes H even in the general dynamical
case.
Showing that H is a Shannon entropy is an important
step, but it raises more questions then it answers. The
probability distribution on the boundary seems to be a
classical analog of a density matrix in AdS/CFT, but it
is quite unclear what the meaning of the distribution is.
This paper does not give a unique or physically motivated
deﬁnition of the probability distribution, we only show
that it exists in many cases.
Fortunately, holographic Shannon entropy itself stands
on stronger physical grounds. In addition to our com-
ments above about the covariant entropy bound, the best
hint about the underlying meaning of H comes from an
outer entropy computation based on the ideas of [15, 16].
Computing the outer entropy of a surface means holding
the spacetime outside of the surface ﬁxed while coarse
graining over all possibilities for the unknown region in
the interior of the surface. The most famous result about
outer entropy is that the outer entropy of an apparent
horizon is equal to its area, but there is a quickly grow-
ing collection of other intriguing results [17–19].
In the following section, we will make the case that the
holographic Shannon entropy of a region A is the reg-
ulated outer entropy of its entangling surface with the
complement entanglement wedge held ﬁxed. Our argu-
ment is plagued by the divergence of H(A), but the result
still appears to be the only reasonable answer to give
for the outer entropy of the entanglement wedge of A
upon regulation. This is consistent with what we would
speculate with the Bousso bound. After all, the original

purpose of holographic entropy bounds is to estimate an
upper bound for the gravitational entropy inside of a sur-
face, a counting of the number of spacetimes that could
be hidden behind a wall. Our results add some conﬁdence
to this idea: the area of an entanglement wedge counts
the number of states consistent with the ﬁxed geometry
in the complement wedge.

II.
MOTIVATION: OUTER ENTROPY OF THE
ENTANGLEMENT WEDGE

The geometrical construction of holographic Shannon
entropy can be motivated in two separate ways.
The
ﬁrst is an attempt to answer a question related to gravi-
tational entropy which we now pose.
Consider a classical asymptotically locally AdS space-
time M0 in the context of AdS/CFT in the large N limit
with conformal boundary ∂M0. Let B0 be a Cauchy sur-
face for ∂M0. We are assuming that ∂M0 is the entire
boundary so that there is a pure quantum state |ψ0⟩
on a CFT on B0 which describes the spacetime.
Di-
vide B0 into two disjoint subregions: A1 and A2 so that
B0 = A1 ∪A2. Consider the entanglement wedge of A1,
denoted EW(A1, M0) or just EW(A1) if we have clearly
speciﬁed M0. We also use the terminology outer wedge of
A1, denoted OW(A1, M0), to refer to the entanglement
wedge of A2 rather than A1.
Suppose that we only have access to the outer wedge of
A1 and that the the entanglement wedge of A1 is hidden
from our observation. What entropy should be assigned
to quantify this lack of information about the entire bulk?
In other words, what is the outer entropy of the entan-
glement wedge of A1?
Consider a collection of density matrices on the the
Hilbert space of B0 consistent with the outer wedge of A1
being held ﬁxed. Recall that we had access to a speciﬁc
pure quantum state |ψ0⟩which was associated with the
spacetime M0. Put

Ω=

ρ on B0
TrA1 (ρ) = TrA1 (|ψ0⟩⟨ψ0|)

.

In other words, Ωis the collection of all density matri-
ces on B0 subject to the condition that if ρ ∈Ω, then
upon tracing out A1 to a reduced ρA2, we always ﬁnd
that ρA2 = ρ0
A2 where ρ0
A2 = |ψ0⟩⟨ψ0|. This concept is
illustrated in ﬁgure 2.
We now attempt to compute a quantity we denote by
◦
S(A1) deﬁned as

◦
S(A1) = sup

S(ρ)
ρ ∈Ω

(2)

where S denotes von Neumann entropy. This calculation
should provide an estimate of the desired gravitational
entropy of the entanglement wedge of A1. At heart it is a
very similar calculation to that of [15, 16] because we are
varying over density matrices consistent with a condition

on the outer wedge OW(A1, M0). The notation
◦
S(A1)

FIG. 2.
The collection Ωis the set of density matrices on
A1A2 = B0 with the property that TrA1ρ is the same as the
reduced density matrix in the known entanglement wedge of
A2. Ωprovides a way to quantify the entropy associated with
the missing information about the wedge of A1.

is somewhat unclear because it depends not only on the
region A1 but also on the original reduced density matrix
on A2 as well as a cutoﬀprescription on the CFT.

The quantity
◦
S is divergent, but this is no reason to
ignore its structure upon regulation. Fix some regular-
ization procedure that makes it so that von Neumann en-
tropy cannot diverge. More precisely, if A is a subregion
of B0, we are now guaranteed that there is a (ﬁnite) posi-
tive number S⋆(A) which is the maximum of entropies on
A when varying over all density matrices on the Hilbert
space. We are now guaranteed by subadditivity that if
ρ ∈Ω,

S(ρ) ≤S(ρA1) + S(ρA2) ≤S⋆(A1) + |γ(A1)|

4Gℏ
(3)

where we have replaced S(ρA2) by the von Neumann en-
tropy computed by the HRT formula for the region A2
in the state ψ0. This is a justiﬁed manipulation because
ρ ∈Ω. Note that the area of the HRT surface γ(A1) is
cut oﬀby the regularization, but it is still computed in
the original bulk spacetime M0 associated with the pure
state ψ0.
The upper bound (3) can be saturated because we
can take a density matrix ρ⋆
A1 with the maximal entropy
S⋆(A1) on A1 and put

ρ = ρ⋆
A1 ⊗TrA1 (|ψ0⟩⟨ψ0|)

which is obviously in Ωand obviously saturates (3). We
thus have

◦
S(A1) = S⋆(A1) + |γ(A1)|

4GN
(4)

which is precisely our formula for holographic Shannon
entropy if we interpret S⋆(A1) as the cutoﬀarea (or CFT
volume) of A1.

Geometrical outer entropy

This section can be skipped without a major loss of
continuity for readers more interested in the properties
of holographic Shannon entropy rather than its “deriva-
tion.”
There another very similar way to arrive at the holo-
graphic Shannon entropy formula which may appeal more
to a relativist because it is a purely geometrical con-
struction that does not rely on statements about den-
sity operators. This second approach is directly based
on the concept of outer entropy. However, we will need
to generalize the deﬁnition of outer entropy in a way that
may cause some discomfort and to be as clear as possible
about the strengths and weaknesses of this approach, we
use the term geometrical outer entropy below to distin-
guish from the original deﬁnition of outer entropy given
in [15].
The situation is similar to the above: M0 is a ﬁxed
asymptotically locally AdS spacetime with D dimensions
that satisﬁes the null curvature condition. The conformal
boundary ∂M0 may consist of multiple connected com-
ponents. B0 is a (D −2 dimensional) Cauchy surface of
∂M0. Note that the number of connected components
of B0 is the same as the number of components of ∂M0.
Let Σ be a spacelike AdS-Cauchy surface for M0 with
B0 ⊂Σ. Let σ be a D −2 dimensional (spacelike) sub-
manifold of Σ. σ will then be homologous to some sub-
region of B0 which may or may not be all of B0. In any
case, we ﬁnd A1, A2 ⊂B0 with σ anchored to A1 ∩A2,
A1 ∪A2 = B0, and such that the regions only intersect
at their mutual boundaries. This is the standard setup
for computing holographic entanglement entropy of A1
in the case where σ is extremal, but we are not making
that assumption yet. σ need not have anything to do
with an entanglement wedge.
Let K denote the subset of Σ that lies between σ and
A2. The domain of dependence of K is a dimension D
region which is called the outer wedge of σ on the A2
side. We will denote it simply by W(σ, A2). We will not
call this the outer wedge of A1 in the spacetime M0 be-
cause σ is not an HRT surface. Our insistence to include
A2 as an argument to W is because σ is not necessarily
homologous to the boundary.
We now consider the collection of all spacetimes that
are identical to M0 in W(σ, A2) but otherwise uncon-
strained. Suppose that
¯
M is an asymptotically locally
AdS spacetime obeying the null curvature and generic
condition with the property that the conformal bound-
ary of ¯
M has copies ¯
A1 and ¯
A2 of A1 and A2 respectively.
We will say that ¯
M is equivalent to M0 on the A2 side of
σ if there exists a dimension D subregion W of ¯
M with
D∩∂¯
M = ¯
A2 such that W is isometric to the outer wedge

FIG. 3.
Holographic Shannon deﬁnition is deﬁned almost
identically to the HRT formula for covariant holographic en-
tanglement entropy. In the ﬁgure on the left above, the area
of the black surface gives the usual von Neumann entropy of
the red region A1. In the ﬁgure on the right, the area of the
black surface, which now includes A1 as well as its entangling
surface, produces what we call holographic Shannon entropy.

W(σ, A2). The collection of all spacetimes equivalent to
M0 on the A2 side of σ is denoted by C(M0, σ, A2).
The subtleties of our deﬁnition of equivalence are well-
illustrated by an example shown in ﬁgure 3. An AdS-
Schwarzschild black hole with two asymptotic regions A1
and A2 is shown in the upper ﬁgure. The surface σ is
the entangling surface of A1 in this example, but that is
unnecessary. The lower half of the ﬁgure is the disjoint
union of two spacetimes.
(We use the tensor product
symbol as a reminder of how such a spacetime is treated
in AdS/CFT). The lower pair is equivalent to the origi-
nal black hole on the A2 side of σ. Notice how the new
spacetime still has copies of the original regions A1 and
A2, but that it also has additional new asymptotic re-
gions. Also note that one of the black holes in the new
spacetime has a diﬀerent structure.
There is a critical observation to be made about
this deﬁnition of equivalence.
Suppose that
¯
M
∈
C(M0, σ, A2). Then there must be a surface ¯σ in ¯
M which
is to homologous to ¯A2 and which has the same (regu-
lated) area as σ. However, there is no guarantee that ¯σ is
also homologous to ¯A1. This is because the spacetime ¯
M
may have a conformal boundary with additional regions
beyond ¯A1 and ¯A2.
The size of C(M0, σ, A2) is a seemingly good start-
ing place when assessing the entropy associated with not
knowing the gravitational information on the A1 side of
σ. However, this set is far too large as it includes arbi-
trary and completely pointless extensions of the space-
time with additional disconnected components.
To solve this problem, we follow [15, 16] and take
¯
M ∈C(M0, σ, A2) without restriction, but we compute
the HRT entropy only of ¯A1 ∪¯A2 which, as mentioned
above, is not necessarily the entire boundary. This en-
tropy is bounded upon regularization to some maximal
value S⋆(A1) + S⋆(A2) which is proportional to the reg-
ulated CFT volume of A1 and A2.1

1 There is no need to use bars on arguments to S⋆since Ai and

This estimate of the entropy associated with coarse-
graining over the region on the A1 side of σ in the space-
time M0 is what we refer to as geometrical outer entropy
and is denoted as

◦
S(σ, A2) = sup
|γ( ¯B(M))|

M ∈C(M0, σ, A2)

. (5)

4GN

In this expression, ¯B(M) means the region ¯A1 ∪¯A2 asso-
ciated with the spacetime M and γ(A) is the HRT surface
of A. Note that it would be better to put M0 as an ar-

gument for
◦
S but we avoid this since it will be clear from
context what initial spacetime we are working with.
This formula for geometrical outer entropy is based on
the same ideas as in section II and in [15]. We are essen-
tially imagining that our original spacetime corresponds

to a pure quantum state ψ0 on A1∪A2 and that
◦
S is com-
puting, by way of the HRT formula, the von Neumann
entropy of the density matrix

ρ = 1

X

ψ∈C(ψ0,σ,A2)
|ψ⟩⟨ψ|

n

where n is a normalizing constant and C(ψ0, σ, A2) is the
collection of pure quantum states on A1 ∪A2 subject to
the condition that the spacetime is ﬁxed on the A2 side
of σ.
We now consider the case where σ = γ(A1) so that
the outer wedge W(σ, A2) is in fact the entanglement
wedge EW(A2). In this case we will refer to W(σ, A2) as
the outer wedge of A1 and denote it by OW(A1). The

argument is now similar to that in section II.
◦
S(σ, A2)
is bounded above by S⋆(A1) + |γ(A1)|

because it is the
supremum of the set

The HRT formula satisﬁes subadditivity and the entropy
of ¯A2 is guaranteed to be |γ(A1)|

4GN
by the deﬁnition of C
while the entropy of ¯A1 is bounded by S⋆(A1) upon reg-
ularization.
To see the the upper bound is saturated, we can let
¯
M be the disjoint union of two bulks M1 and M2. M1
is an isometric copy of M0, but the regions correspond-
ing to A1 and A2 will be denoted by ¯C1 and ¯A2, re-
spectively. (This labeling is extremely important.). The
second spacetime M2 has a boundary ∂M2 which also
consists of copies of A1 and A2 but we label them by ¯A1
and ¯C2, respectively. The spacetime M2 is not the same
as M0. Instead, we take it to be a black hole with the
largest possible temperature, after regulation, so that en-
tropies of subregions go like regulated CFT volume. In

¯
Ai have the same volume (after regularization).

this spacetime, γ( ¯A1 ∪¯A2) is a disjoint union of a copy
of (a copy of) the original HRT surface γ(A1) and a sur-
face pressed up against A1 at the boundary. The outer
entropy with OW(A1) = EW(A2) held ﬁxed is thus the
sum of two terms: the holographic entanglement entropy
of A1 in the original spacetime, and a much larger term
proportional to the regulated volume of A1.

III.
MOTIVATION AND EXISTENCE:
STABILIZER STATES

There is a very diﬀerent motivation for the holographic
Shannon entropy formula which comes a property of sta-
bilizer quantum states. An elegant discussion of stabilizer
states can be found in [20], but a detailed knowledge of
the subject is not a prerequisite for this section.
Let d ≥2 be an integer and let H =
 
Cd⊗n be the
Hilbert space of n qu-d-its.
Gross and Walter proved
that if ρ is a stabilizer state on H, then there exists a
classical joint probability distribution p with the follow-
ing entropic property. Suppose that I is any subset of
{1, 2, . . . , n} and that ρI and pI denote, respectively, the
reduced density matrix and marginal probability distri-
bution on the copies of
 
Cd
and Xi indexed by i ∈I.
Then, the von Neumann entropy S(ρI) and Shannon en-
tropy H(pI) are related by

S(ρI) = H(pI) −|I| log d.
(6)

The factor of log d arises because we insist on using nat-
ural logarithms rather than base d to avoid confusion
involving holographic entanglement.
The result (6) establishes a remarkable relationship
between classical and quantum information in certain
cases. The most direct consequence of the relationship
is that every balanced classical information inequality2

holds for von Neumann entropies of stabilizer quantum
states [12, 20].
This fact follows directly from (6) be-
cause the term proportional to |I| cancels on both sides
of a balanced inequality.3

2 When we refer to classical information inequalities, we mean in-
equalities linear in Shannon entropies of probability distributions
that are valid for all distributions. In other words, let I be the
power set of {1, . . . , n} with the empty set removed and ﬁx a
function c : I →R. Suppose that for any probability distribu-
tion p on n random variables, P
I∈I c(I)H(pI) ≥0 where pI is
the marginal of p on the subset of variables indexed by I. Then,
we say that c furnishes a classical information inequality. Strong
subadditivity is an example, but there are many more [14]. In-
formation inequalities like H(A) + H(B) ≥H(AB) are balanced
which means that for any j ∈{1, . . . , n}, P

I∈{I′i∈I′} c(I) = 0.

Inequalities like H(AB) ≥H(A) are not balanced because B
appears only on the left hand side.
3
There is an unsettled conjecture due to Cadney, Linden, and
Winter (CLW) that this result is not a special property of sta-
bilizer states but rather that every quantum state satisﬁes every

Equation (6) already looks like the holographic Shan-
non entropy formula because upon regularization, the
volume of a boundary region is proportional to the
number of constituent subsystems.
In fact, we can
now make a powerful assertion. Consider a static bulk
where the Ryu-Takayanagi formula applies. We can di-
vide the boundary into a large number of subregions
R1, R2, . . . Rn and assign to each a single qubit upon reg-
ularization. The Ryu-Takayanagi formula allows us to
compute the von Neumann entropy of ∪i∈IRi for any
subset of indices I. These entropies can be reproduced
to arbitrary precision by stabilizer states on n parties
by an argument involving random tensor networks [23].
Thus, there is a joint probability distribution p on n ran-
dom variables, one associated to each of the regions Ri,
such that the Shannon entropy H(pI) of the marginal
associated with the region ∪i∈IRi is given by the area
of its RT surface plus |I| log 2. By making the standard
holographic identiﬁcation

log 2 = |Ri|

4GN
for every qubit-containing subregion Ri, we obtain equa-
tion (1).
So, up to the cumbersome issue of regularization, we
can conclude that in static cases there is some probabil-
ity distribution jointly deﬁned on local random variables
on the boundary with Shannon entropies given by equa-
tion (1) for all marginals, no matter their topology. In
dynamical cases where entangling surfaces are computed
with the HRT formula or by the approach of [11], we
are not yet in a position to prove that a probability dis-
tribution realizing equation (1) exists. However, such a
distribution exists if the dynamical holographic entropy
cone for N parties lies within the N party stabilizer cone
[20] as this would allow us to apply the result of [12] for
the dynamical case just like the static case.
In fact, it may turn out that the dynamical case isn’t
nearly as threatening as it appears. There is currently a
great deal of interest in the open problem asking whether
or not the dynamical and static holographic entropy
cones for N parties are in fact, the same thing!
The
monogamy of mutual information inequality [24] guar-
antees that this is the case for N ≤4 regions.
Un-
fortunately, the 5 party static entropy cone is deﬁned
by a collection of known inequalities [25, 26] of which
several cannot be proven with standard methods [13].
These inequalities have already undergone some dynam-
ical testing [27] with no violation thus far. Recent in-
vestigations [28–31] have found structure to holographic

balanced classical entropy inequality [21]. This is what happened
with strong subadditivity [22], but given how much harder the
proof of quantum strong subadditivity is than that of classical
strong subadditivity, it could be extremely diﬃcult to provide a
similar proof for even the quantum version of the Zhang-Yeung
inequality [14]. There are holographic consequences if the CLW
conjecture is correct [13].

case.

PROPERTIES OF HOLOGRAPHIC
SHANNON ENTROPY

The conclusions above strongly suggest that we take
equation (1) seriously. Even if the outer entropy argu-
ment has an element of hand-waving to it and even if the
stabilizer state argument is taken only as an existence
proof, there is still an accumulation of evidence that for
some reason or another, (1) is an important ﬁnding. With
this in mind, we now clean up the geometrical area for-
mula, providing a more formal deﬁnition, and we quickly
prove some of its properties that suggest a Shannon en-
tropy interpretation.
Fix a globally hyperbolic spacetime M (or at lease a
spacetime with a globally hyperbolic conformal compact-
iﬁcation) obeying the null energy and generic conditions.
Do not assume that M is asymptotically locally AdS. Let
σ be a connected compact spacelike codimension 2 sur-
face in M with future-directed null orthogonal vector
ﬁelds k and l.
θk and θl, satisfy θk ≥0 and θl ≤0.
Take a Cauchy surface Σ0 that contains σ and consider
the domain of dependence of the part of Σ0 which is in-
side of σ. By “inside” we mean in the direction of l −k
from σ. Denote this domain of dependence by Dσ.
Let A be a subregion of σ and let γ(A) denote the
smallest extremal surface homologous to A that lies in-
side of Dσ. The area of γ(A) will still be called holo-
graphic entanglement entropy even though it is not an-
chored to an AdS boundary.
Like conventional holo-
graphic entanglement entropy [24, 32, 33], the construc-
tion here satisﬁes monogamy of mutual information and
strong subadditivity [11].
The holographic Shannon entropy of A ⊂σ is the quan-
tity

H(A) =
1
4GN
(|A| + |γ(A)|)

where |A| is the area of A and γ(A) is the entangling
surface of A as deﬁned in the previous paragraph. Note
that in this context, the neither term is divergent, al-
though the ﬁrst term is always greater than or equal to
the second [11].
The most important geometrical results we currently
know about this construction are the following pair of
theorems:

Theorem 1. Let A and B be subregions of σ which
are disjoint except, perhaps, at their boundaries. Then,
H(AB) ≥H(A).

Proof. Recall that the entangling surfaces of regions on
σ lie in the domain of dependence Dσ. Wall’s entangle-
ment wedge nesting theorem [33] was generalized in [11]
to show that we can ﬁnd a topologically closed spacelike
surface Σ anchored to σ such that

1. The domain of dependence of Σ is Dσ

2. γ(A) ⊂Σ and γ(AB) ⊂Σ

3. γ(A) and γ(AB) are minimal area surfaces on Σ
anchored to ∂A and ∂(AB) respectively.

Notice that γ(AB) ∪B is a non-minimal surface on
Σ anchored and homologous to A.
Thus, |γ(A)| ≤
|γ(AB)| + |B| so

|A| + |γ(A)| ≤|A| + |B| + |γ(AB)|.

Theorem 2. Every balanced inequality that applies to
covariant holographic entanglement on compact a com-
pact surface applies holographic Shannon entropy.

Proof. This is obvious because in balanced inequalities,
the term proportional to volume of a region cancels on
both sides of the inequality.

The ﬁrst of these theorems relates to the most fa-
mous distinction between classical and quantum correla-
tion. Consider two random variables A and B and their
joint probability distribution p. The entropy of A is the
expectation value of −log p(A) so it measures the ex-
pected “surprisal” of A. If we always measure B before
measuring A, we should expect to be less surprised by
A, so the conditional entropy H(A|B), deﬁned as the
expectation value of −log p(A|B), must be no greater
than H(A). Because p(a, b) = p(a|b)p(b), it follows that
H(AB) = H(A|B) + H(B), and from this we see that
H(A|B) ≤H(A) is the statement of subadditivity, a
property that classical and quantum correlations hold in
common. However, quantum mechanically we can have
S(AB) = 0 while S(A) > 0 so that S(A|B) < 0 while
classically H(A|B) is the expectation value of a positive
random variable.
Shannon
entropy
thus
satisﬁes
monotonicity:
H(AB)
≥
H(A) while von Neumann entropy does
not. The holographic Shannon entropy formula and the
HRT formula share this critical distinction.
On the other hand, the second theorem shows that
there is a large family of information inequalities that
the two constructions have in common.
In particular,
we immediately conclude that H satisﬁes monogamy of
mutual information and strong subadditivity, the ﬁrst of
which is not satisﬁed by all probability distributions. The
second theorem also allows us to conclude, becuase of the
ﬁndings of [13], that H satisﬁes a large class of known
classical inequalities. These include those of [14, 34, 35].
However, the balanced inequalities found in [36] are not
yet proven for the dynamical holographic entropy cone
[13] and are thus not proven for holographic Shannon
entropy.

REMAINING QUESTIONS

The simple construction given here is promising and
problematic. In the static case with a compact or reg-
ulated AdS boundary, there is no doubt that the holo-
graphic Shannon entropy formula is really computing all
of the Shannon entropies of the marginals of some prob-
ability distribution. In the general dynamical case, there
are already enough known inequalities satisﬁed by H, es-
pecially monotonicity, to have some conﬁdence that there
is no need to restrict to static spacetimes. But what prob-
ability distribution are we talking about? The stabilizer
state methodology can be taken as an existence proof,
but it leaves much to be desired. Is there some classi-
cal probability distribution deﬁned on local subsystems
of the boundary that arises for a physical or natural rea-
son? Does this hypothetical distribution directly relate
to the concepts of outer entropy of entangling surfaces?
Is there a classical form of holography that could have
an impact on classical information theory? Some steps
in this direction appear to have been considered in [37].

The most important question about this mysterious
probability distribution is its relationship to outer en-
tropy. Counting gravitational states is an old and chal-
lenging problem in quantum gravity and it has been
largely hindered by the diﬃculty of deﬁning local subsys-
tems in general relativity. However, entanglement wedge
reconstruction oﬀers one way that spatial regions can be
separated from one another, and it is obviously impor-
tant to ask how many diﬀerent spacetimes or states ﬁt
into an entanglement wedge. The answer is apparently
the obvious holographic one: the area of boundary of the
wedge including both the bulk and boundary sides of the
wedge. The Bousso entropy bound is saturated [38].
